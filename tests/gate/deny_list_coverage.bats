# Mechanizes the ownership test that found 3 unprotected files across two
# separate audit rounds (a human/agent had to notice each omission by
# inspection). Runs the REAL _write_hooks and _write_trust_root_settings
# functions from install.sh, then walks every file they actually wrote to
# .githooks/ and .claude/hooks/ (both entirely install.sh-owned — never
# agent-generated), asserting each one is covered by the generated
# .claude/settings.json deny-list. A future file added to either directory
# without a matching deny entry fails this test immediately, instead of
# waiting for the next audit round to notice by hand.
