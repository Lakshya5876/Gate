# Regression coverage for a real red-team finding: gate.sh's cold-start scan
# scope (no last_pass_sha recorded for this branch — a fresh clone, brand
# new branch, or a wiped gate_state.json ledger) computed CHANGED_FILES via
# `git diff --cached --name-only` even at GATE_TRIGGER=pre-push. That's
# correct for pre-commit (files are staged at that point) but wrong for
# pre-push: by the time pre-push runs, the commit has already landed and the
# index is clean, so `--cached` is unconditionally empty regardless of what
# the push actually contains. HAS_BACKEND/HAS_FRONTEND then evaluated false,
# silently skipping lint/type/complexity/layer-boundary for the entire push
# while still printing "GATE PASS: all checks clean". Fixed by scanning the
# whole tracked tree (git ls-files) on a pre-push cold start, matching the
# CI cold-start philosophy.
