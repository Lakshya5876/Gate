#!/usr/bin/env bash
# install.sh — Claude Code governance framework installer
# Usage: ./install.sh  (must be run from within the cloned repository)
#
# What this does:
#   1. Detects basket (greenfield vs brownfield) and validates preconditions
#   2. Downloads and copies governance files into the target repo
#   3. Installs git hooks and configures core.hooksPath
#   4. Installs code-review-graph MCP server (pipx — zero user knowledge required)
#   5. Builds the initial multi-domain graph
#   6. Writes .mcp.json (project-scoped, committed — not global settings)
#   7. Scaffolds org-level token policy if absent
#   8. Prints the one remaining human step (run /init-governance)
#
# NOTE ON graphify: safishamsi/graphify was evaluated and rejected — unnaturally
# high star count (68k, likely botted) indicates unverified provenance. Multi-domain
# graph coverage (SQL, infra, CI) is achieved here via code-review-graph extended
# file patterns instead.
