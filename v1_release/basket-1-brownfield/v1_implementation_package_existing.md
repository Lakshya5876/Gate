# CLAUDE CODE — WORKSPACE INITIALIZATION PACKAGE
## Edition: EXISTING REPOSITORIES (Brownfield)

**Companion document:** `v1_claude_code_development_guide_existing.md` (the Guide)
**Time required:** ~25 minutes, one time per repository
**Outcome:** The repository becomes a stateful, hook-enforced, senior-grade
agentic engineering environment — without blocking on pre-existing debt.

> **Status: V1 production-ready.** Specification verified through 3 audit rounds and mechanically tested: pre-commit fingerprint receipts, coverage gate, CORE_FILES tier-3 escalation, identity-based debt ratchet, CI backstop, and IDE extension crash guard all confirmed functional. Install and proceed.

---

> [!CAUTION]
> ## V1 STRUCTURAL CEILING — MANDATORY PRE-CHECK BEFORE INITIALIZATION
>
> **This V1 Brownfield Reconnaissance Package enforces a hard ceiling of ≤ 1,000,000 Lines of Code (1M LOC) (LOC).**
>
> It is optimized for standard single-root applications and microservices. Above 1M LOC, the automated
> repository reconnaissance phase causes **severe context window inflation and performance degradation**
> during initial scanning. Projects exceeding this threshold are not supported in V1 and must wait for
> the **V2 Enterprise Monorepo Release**.
>
> ### YOU MUST RUN THIS CHECK BEFORE PROCEEDING
>
> Execute the following universal, language-agnostic command at your project root. It works on any stack
> (Python, Node, Go, Java, Ruby, etc.) and counts every tracked source file without scanning
> untracked build artifacts or dependencies:
>
> ```bash
> find . -type f \
>   -not -path "*/.git/*" \
>   -not -path "*/node_modules/*" \
>   -not -path "*/.venv/*" \
>   -not -path "*/__pycache__/*" \
>   -not -path "*/vendor/*" \
>   -not -path "*/dist/*" \
>   -not -path "*/build/*" \
>   -not -path "*/.next/*" \
>   | xargs wc -l 2>/dev/null | tail -1
> ```
>
> **Decision rule — read the `total` number from the last line of output:**
>
> | Result | Action |
> |---|---|
> | ≤ 1,000,000 LOC (1M) | Proceed to STEP 1 below |
> | > 1,000,000 LOC (1M) | **STOP. Do not proceed.** This repository exceeds the V1 ceiling. Halt initialization and wait for the V2 Enterprise Monorepo release. |
>
> Do not skip this check. Do not estimate. Run the command, read the number, then decide.

## STEP 1 — PRE-FLIGHT (human developer action)

1. Confirm a clean working tree: `git status` shows "nothing to commit, working
   tree clean".
2. Create and switch to a setup branch — never run init on main/master/develop:
   `git checkout -b chore/claude-init`
3. Confirm your test framework, linter, and type checker are installed and run
   from the repo root (e.g. `pytest`, `jest`, `ruff`, `eslint`, `mypy`, `tsc`).
4. Ensure you have executed the installer script (`/path/to/ai-dev-workflow/install.sh`) from within this repository's root.
5. **Permission-mode check:** never run the init (or any session in a governed
   repo) with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. The generated settings pin
   `defaultMode: "default"`; that pin only protects you if you don't override it
   at the CLI.
6. **Monorepo note:** if your repository contains multiple independently deployed
   packages/services, run this init once PER PACKAGE you want governed, from that
   package's root — one constitution per package, never one global constitution
   for a monorepo.

## STEP 2 — INITIALIZATION (paste the master prompt)

Open Claude Code at the repository (or package) root. Paste the entire prompt
below verbatim and press Enter.

The init runs in TWO halves with a human checkpoint between them:
- **Half 1 (read-only):** staged reconnaissance → DISCOVERY REPORT. Claude writes
  NOTHING yet.
- **You confirm or correct the report.** This is the only conversational step, and
  it is deliberate: a wrong architecture discovery poisons every gate decision
  afterwards. Thirty seconds of your review prevents that.
- **Half 2 (write):** all files are generated, grounded in the confirmed report.

---------------------------------- PROMPT START ----------------------------------

Read the file `v1_claude_code_development_guide_existing.md` in this repository's root.
It is the engineering standard this initialization implements — internalize
Sections 2 (configuration), 4 (stateful layer + enforcement hooks), 5 (gates),
6 (testing discipline), and SECTION 2.5 (cognitive routing + execution gates)
before doing anything.

CRITICAL: SECTION 2.5 rules are NON-NEGOTIABLE and fire on EVERY task in this
governed repository, starting immediately after initialization:

SECTION 2.5 — COGNITIVE ROUTING & EXECUTION GATES (Always Active)

  2.5.1 — MODEL INTERCEPT (Cognitive Routing)
    Every task triggers automated model selection logic BEFORE execution:
    - Analyze task type: (architecture | security | performance | test | deploy)
    - Route to appropriate model if available; fallback to primary if not
    - This routing is NON-BYPASSING — the agent cannot override it
    - Task routing decisions are logged in gate_state.json ledger

  2.5.2 — EXECUTION MODE DECLARATION (Menu Gate)
    Before ANY file is written, the agent MUST declare ONE of:
      [ ] MUST OUTPUT: task is design/analysis/report — no code changes, only text
      [ ] HARD STOP: task requires human approval before proceeding (new dep,
          auth change, schema change, CORE_FILES edit, settings change)
      [ ] EXECUTE: task is code change — proceed with full pipeline
    Wrong declaration blocks the task. The agent cannot change mode mid-task.

  2.5.3 — GRAPH MEMORY PROTOCOL (Tool Invocation Rules)
    Every tool call is context-aware and logged:
    - Read tools: logged once per file per session (avoid re-reads)
    - Bash commands: cached stdout for 5-minute reuse window
    - Edit/Write tools: require prior Read call (trust-root rule)
    - Web/External tools: only after exhausting local codebase tools
    - If tool call is repetitive (same call within 10 mins): STOP and analyze
    - Graph memory (what the agent knows about the codebase) expires at
      session boundary; new session = fresh recon

  2.5.4 — GITFLOW BRANCH ENFORCEMENT (Hard Block on Protected Branches)
    These rules are MECHANICAL, never conditional:
    - BLOCK HARD: any git push to main / master / develop (pre-push hook refuses)
    - BLOCK HARD: git commit on main / master / develop (feature branch mandate)
    - Feature branch naming: feature/*, fix/*, docs/*, chore/* only
    - Pre-push hook verifies branch protection BEFORE auth/network checks
    - User cannot override; no --force, no --no-verify, no exceptions
    - Protected-branch bypass requires human-authored PR + code review
    - Protected branch = main, master, develop, production, release/*

  2.5.5 — TOKEN HARNESS & COST AWARENESS (Hard Blocks at Budget Thresholds)
    Token budgets are PER-TASK, non-negotiable:
    - Task token budget: 200,000 tokens (default, specified in system prompt)
    - Soft warning at 70% (140,000 tokens): agent must summarize & checkpoint
    - Hard block at 100% (200,000 tokens): execution STOPS immediately
    - History retransmission waste (repeated passages) hard block at 50%
      - If retransmitted content exceeds 50% of budget, task halts
    - When hard block fires: state what is known, what remains unfinished,
      write all checkpoints, then exit (never continue on next token window)
    - Token budget resets per task; cannot carry over or negotiate up
    - Cost warnings MUST be emitted to user at 80%, 90%, 100%

  2.5.6 — EXECUTION PIPELINE INVARIANTS (Always Fire, Never Bypass)
    Every code-change task auto-triggers this pipeline without confirmation:
    Step 1: RECON (read-only) — grep, locate, scope the change
    Step 2: CONTRACT (internal) — SCOPE/OBJECTIVE/CONSTRAINTS/VERIFY/OUTPUT
    Step 3: EXECUTE — write code, run tests, verify gates
    Step 4: OUTPUT — change manifest, test results, commit message
    
    Hard stops within pipeline: new dependency, auth change, schema change,
    CORE_FILES edit, settings change, permission-mode change, hook modification.
    Agent states the hard stop, waits for human approval, cannot self-resolve.

  2.5.7 — VS CODE / IDE EXTENSION CRASH GUARD (Non-Bypassing Environment Rule)
    Before outputting the Execution Mode Menu (2.5.2/2.5.3) or blocking execution
    on an interactive human choice, the agent MUST check whether it is running
    inside a non-TTY or IDE-extension terminal wrapper (e.g. `[ -t 0 ]` is false,
    or extension env flags such as TERM_PROGRAM=vscode, VSCODE_PID,
    VSCODE_GIT_IPC_HANDLE, CURSOR_*, or a JetBrains terminal marker are present).
    Sequential interactive dialog loops choke the extension's sub-process pipeline
    and crash the editor window. If an extension / non-interactive environment is
    detected:
      1. DO NOT launch an interactive choice loop or call AskUserQuestions
         sequentially.
      2. EXECUTION MODE MENU: automatically select option [1] DIRECT as the safe
         default, log the auto-selection to .claude/session_state.json
         (mode=DIRECT, reason=extension_crash_guard, timestamp), and output the
         high-visibility line:
         "[CRASH GUARD] VS Code/IDE extension detected. Suppressing interactive
          menu and defaulting to Option 1 (DIRECT) to prevent UI crash."
      3. HARD STOPS: do NOT stall on an un-answerable prompt loop. State the
         hard-stop parameters clearly in plain text, emit a clean one-line
         warning, write a checkpoint file under .claude/checkpoints/ capturing the
         pending decision, and halt execution awaiting the human's next message —
         never a blocking interactive read.
    This rule is environment-detection only; it never weakens a hard stop's
    requirement for human approval — it changes HOW approval is solicited (async
    text + checkpoint) so the editor cannot freeze. In a real TTY (CLI / desktop
    app) the normal interactive menu and prompts apply unchanged.

  2.5.8 — LONG-SESSION CONTEXT ANCHORING (Ground Truth Re-verification)
    To prevent attention degradation or context amnesia over extended execution
    timelines, treat `CLAUDE.md` on disk as your unalterable ground truth:
    - At the start of every distinct feature phase, task branch, or gate
      invocation, perform a full re-read of `CLAUDE.md` to refresh your
      architectural alignment.
    - gate.sh mechanically detects CLAUDE.md hash drift and warns when the
      constitution has changed since the last verified pass — heed that warning
      by re-reading the file before proceeding.
    - Before executing any remote branch push command, compile and write a
      comprehensive state snapshot to `.claude/checkpoints/LATEST.md` capturing:
      what changed, why, and the architectural delta against baseline. gate.sh
      enforces this at the pre-push boundary for AI-driven push sessions.
    - Your source of truth is the disk ledger, not the chat transcript.

  2.5.9 — DYNAMIC INTERROGATION & COMPULSORY BRAINSTORMING
    Scale architectural skepticism to classified task complexity:
    1. Tier 1 (Trivial/one-liner) or Tier 2 (simple single-file): proceed
       directly to execution without conversational overhead.
    2. Tier 3 (complex/multi-file) and above, or if you possess any
       contextual doubt regarding specifications, edge cases, or upstream
       contracts: you are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN from writing code until you
       execute a dedicated Brainstorming Phase.
    3. Brainstorming Phase Protocol:
       - Explicitly lay out your architectural hypothesis.
       - List the top 3 potential hidden regressions or failure modes.
       - Interrogate the human developer with specific, targeted questions
         to validate assumptions. Do not assume or guess missing
         specifications — demand clarity before a single line of code is
         written to disk.
    gate.sh detects Tier 3+ footprints (≥5 staged files from an active
    session) and warns if no checkpoint exists, reinforcing this rule at
    the mechanical layer.

You are initializing an EXISTING repository. The prime directive: the
constitution you generate DESCRIBES the architecture that actually exists.
Every rule you write will be enforced by mechanical gates and SECTION 2.5
cognitive routing on every future task. A rule that contradicts reality
creates permanent noise.

PHASE A — STAGED RECONNAISSANCE (READ-ONLY. Write NOTHING in this phase.)

Execute in this exact order, cheapest first, and respect the budget caps:

  A1. STRUCTURE PASS (no file contents):
      - git ls-files | wc -l   (record total file count)
      - Directory tree to depth 3 with per-directory file counts
      - If total tracked files exceed 5,000: STOP after this pass, show me the
        top-level map, and ask which subsystem/package this constitution should
        govern. Re-scope all later passes to my answer.

  A2. MANIFEST PASS (manifests only, no source):
      - Read every dependency manifest present (requirements.txt,
        pyproject.toml, package.json, go.mod, Cargo.toml, pom.xml, etc.)
      - Read lockfile NAMES only (do not parse lockfile contents)
      - Read CI config filenames (.circleci/, .github/workflows/, etc.)
      - Identify: language(s) + versions, frameworks, test runner, linter,
        type checker, build tool — record the EXACT commands the repo uses
        (from CI config and manifest scripts, not from your assumptions).

  A3. SAMPLED SOURCE PASS (strictly budgeted):
      - From the A1 map, identify the apparent architectural layers (whatever
        they actually are — handlers/, services/, lib/, utils/, a flat src/).
      - Read 2–3 representative files PER layer, using offset+limit section
        reads where files exceed ~200 lines. HARD CAP: 15 files total.
      - From these, record: real naming conventions (function/class/file
        naming as it IS), how errors are handled, how config/env vars are
        accessed, how the DB or external services are called, how auth is
        enforced, how tests are structured and what they mock.

  A4. DEPENDENCY-GRAPH PASS (for CORE_FILES and test impact):
      - Build a coarse import graph (grep import statements; this graph is a
        LOWER BOUND — note where re-exports, dynamic imports, or DI/fixture
        injection exist, because grep cannot see through them).
      - Record every module imported by more than 5 other modules, plus
        config, base models, DI wiring, and test fixtures — this becomes the
        CORE_FILES list.
      - Identify available test-impact tooling for the stack (pytest-testmon,
        jest --changedSince, go test rdeps, bazel). If none is installed AND
        the suite exceeds ~200 tests, installation at init is MANDATORY
        (Guide §6 T3) — never deferred to "when the suite gets slow". It is
        a dependency hard stop: request my approval in the discovery report.

  A5. DEBT BASELINE PASS (identities, not just counts; fix NOTHING):
      - Run the repo's linter, type checker, and (if available for the
        stack) security scanner.
      - For EVERY finding record: file, rule id, line, and a finding
        fingerprint. FINGERPRINT ALGORITHM: hash the tuple
        (normalized_file_path, rule_id, floor(line/5)*5) — bucketed line
        for shift stability. Do NOT re-read source files to compute
        fingerprints; derive them from scanner output only. This keeps
        fingerprint computation O(1) per finding regardless of finding
        count and prevents context inflation on large finding sets.
      - For every debt category with NO available scanner, record the
        category as NO_SCANNER — absence must be loud, not silent.
      - Run the test suite in collection-only mode; record total test count,
        collection cleanliness, and (if cheap) full-suite wall time.
      - Detect layer violations against the A3 architecture; record them
        with the same identity schema.

PHASE B — DISCOVERY REPORT (show me, then STOP and wait)

Present a single report:

  1. STACK: languages, frameworks, exact test/lint/typecheck/build commands
  2. ARCHITECTURE AS FOUND: the real layers, their directories, the real
     dependency direction, where it deviates from clean layering (descriptive,
     no judgment)
  3. CONVENTIONS AS FOUND: naming patterns, error handling style, config
     access pattern, test structure and mocking pattern
  4. DEBT BASELINE: finding counts by category and severity, plus the count
     of distinct finding identities recorded; every NO_SCANNER category
     listed explicitly
  5. CORE_FILES: the proposed list from A4 with each entry's import count
  6. TEST-IMPACT TOOLING: what exists; if none, which tool you propose to
     install (this is a hard stop — I must approve it here)
  7. PROPOSED HARD-STOP LIST: the universal list from Guide §2.2.3 plus any
     repo-specific dangers you observed (e.g. a migrations/ directory, a
     deploy script)
  8. ANYTHING AMBIGUOUS: where you could not determine the convention and
     what you propose to assume

Then STOP. Do not write any file until I reply confirming or correcting the
report. Incorporate my corrections as ground truth — they override your
inferences wherever they conflict.

PHASE C — DEPLOYMENT (after my confirmation, write everything, no further
questions)

  CRITICAL EXECUTION ORDER: Write .claude/settings.json LAST in Phase C, only
  after all other governance files (CLAUDE.md, baseline.json, .githooks/,
  quarantine.txt) have been fully written to disk. Once settings.json is
  written, these files are completely agent-immutable by design. Re-running
  initialization or repairing these files is a human-only action (hand-edit +
  PR); the agent cannot self-repair.

  C1. CLAUDE.md at the repository root — the DESCRIPTIVE constitution:
      - Architecture enforcement section using the CONFIRMED layer names and
        directories (never invented ones), with each layer's owns / must-not /
        calls rules derived from observed reality
      - Naming contracts AS DISCOVERED
      - The universal security invariants (Guide §2.2.2) verbatim
      - The ENFORCEMENT SCOPE rule verbatim from Guide §2.2.1 — constitution
        applies fully to new files and modified regions; untouched legacy is
        exempt until touched; flag debt, never block on it
      - Hard stops: the confirmed list from the report, INCLUDING
        permission-mode/settings changes, CORE_FILES edits, baseline changes
        without an audit receipt, and quarantining a core-covering test
      - The CORE_FILES glob list from the confirmed report
      - The boundary caveats P1–P3 from Guide §2.3 (permission mode pinned,
        git push always standalone — never in compound commands, refspec-force
        banned in text and refused by the pre-push hook)
      - Testing requirements referencing the 3-tier selection model (Guide §6)
        with the repo's EXACT test commands per tier, transitive-closure rule
        for CORE_FILES, and the grep-is-a-lower-bound escalation rule (T5)
      - The auto-pipeline (recon → contract → execute → output) and the
        commit/push gate including mandatory push confirmation, per Guide §5.3
      - Checkpoint trigger rules C1–C5 and the resume protocol, per Guide §4.1
      - A governance note (Guide §2.2.4): CLAUDE.md, the CORE_FILES list,
        settings, hooks, and baseline change ONLY via human-authored PR, never
        via agent edit; the agent never self-maintains the constitution

  C2. .claude/settings.json:
      - "defaultMode": "default" pinned at the top of permissions
      - Allow list: the exact read-only commands, plus this repo's confirmed
        test runner, linter, type checker, and build commands; git add/commit/
        diff/status/log/update-index
      - Deny list: git reset --hard, git rebase, git clean, rm -rf, sudo,
        raw DDL (DROP/TRUNCATE/DELETE FROM), nc/ssh/scp,
        ALL force-push variants ("git push --force", "git push -f",
        "git push --force-with-lease", "git push --mirror",
        "git push --delete"),
        HOOK-EVASION variants ("git commit --no-verify*", "git commit -n *",
        "git push --no-verify*", "git -c core.hooksPath*") — without these,
        the allow-listed git commit is a silent back door around the entire
        enforcement layer,
        "Bash(SKIP_GATE=*)" (the agent must never be able to form the
        bypass; verify the matcher catches env-prefixed commands — if it
        does not, the pre-commit hook must refuse SKIP_GATE when
        agent-environment markers like $CLAUDECODE are present),
        and credential reads: "Read(.env)", "Read(**/.env)",
        "Read(**/.env.*)", "Read(**/*.pem)", "Read(**/id_rsa*)",
        "Read(**/.aws/credentials)", plus the equivalent Bash cat patterns,
        and TRUST-ROOT writes (the agent must be mechanically blocked from
        editing the files that constrain it): "Write(.githooks/**)",
        "Edit(.githooks/**)", "Write(.claude/settings.json)",
        "Edit(.claude/settings.json)", "Write(.claude/baseline.json)",
        "Edit(.claude/baseline.json)", "Write(CLAUDE.md)", "Edit(CLAUDE.md)",
        "Write(v1_claude_code_development_guide_existing.md)",
        "Edit(v1_claude_code_development_guide_existing.md)",
        "Write(v1_implementation_package_existing.md)",
        "Edit(v1_implementation_package_existing.md)",
        "Bash(git notes*remove*)", "Bash(git update-ref -d*)",
        and PERSISTENT-HOOK-DISABLE + UNTRACKED-COMMIT variants:
        "Bash(git config core.hooksPath*)",
        "Bash(git config --add core.hooksPath*)", "Bash(git commit -a*)",
        "Bash(git commit -am*)", "Bash(git commit --amend*)" — the persistent
        git config form disables hooks for the whole clone, and -a/-am/--amend
        break the index-equals-commit-tree guarantee the gate relies on
      - git push appears in NEITHER list (Guide §2.3 — it must prompt
        interactively, not be silently allowed or hard-blocked)

  C3. .claude/baseline.json — the frozen debt baseline (Guide §4.3.2 schema):
      - Per-finding identity records from A5: file -> [{rule, line_hint, fp}]
      - Summary counts, scanners map (including every NO_SCANNER entry),
        generated_at, generated_from_sha
      - This file WILL be committed — it is shared team state

  C4. .claude/commands/ — four command files, with this repo's REAL commands
      substituted into every verification block:
      - feature.md: Phases 0–5 per Guide §3.2 including stubs-first (Phase 2.5,
        mandatory at 3+ files), the three-strike rule, the corrected index
        protocol before every re-run (git update-index -q --refresh; git diff
        --no-ext-diff — refresh reconciles stat metadata ONLY and must be
        paired with a content-level check), TIER 1 tests after each file,
        TIER 2 at the end, and checkpoint evaluation/writes at the phase
        boundaries defined in Guide §4.1.3, and COST-WARNING FIRING per
        Guide §7.1.1 (alert when a task iteration or phase exceeds ~40,000
        context tokens or history-retransmission waste crosses 50%).
        PHASE 2 (Design Declaration): the agent must programmatically deduce
        the testing architecture from repository roots (§6.0 Dynamic Stack
        Inference) — inspect package.json, requirements.txt, pyproject.toml,
        go.mod, or CI config; never assume a fixed runner. If a frontend or
        proxy layer is present, declare Playwright E2E user journeys implicitly
        (web-first async assertions, network contract checks) — zero prompts
        seeking human instruction on test paths.
        PHASE 3 (Implementation): execute all inferred test suites completely
        autonomously using the deduced runner engine(s). When UI/routing/rendering
        paths change, auto-generate and run Playwright specs (*.spec.ts or stack
        equivalent). Sequence backend + E2E runners; both must exit 0. No
        conversational filler or prompts asking the developer for test
        specifications are permitted.
      - audit.md: diff-scoped via the gate script's change set (files changed
        since last_pass_sha + staged + unstaged + untracked; full-repo only on
        explicit request). For file-level scanners apply the HUNK-INTERSECTION
        rule (Guide §4.3.3a): scan the full file, intersect findings against
        git diff -U0 hunk ranges; in-hunk findings are identity-checked
        against baseline (new fp blocks, grandfathered passes); out-of-hunk
        baseline findings are summarized in one line, never as noise.
        Ratchet-down (R2): remove disappeared fingerprints from baseline.json
        and record them in the audit receipt — /review validates every
        baseline decrease against that receipt.
        Finding fps are whitespace/format-insensitive (canonical token
        stream before hashing); a simultaneous all-fp shift in a touched
        file with rule+file+count unchanged is a re-fingerprint event —
        re-anchor, do not block (Guide §4.3.2).
        SEVERITY NORMALIZATION TABLE: generate a mapping from each
        confirmed scanner's NATIVE levels (error/warning, E/W codes,
        HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) AND test-runner output formats (JUnit XML, JSON
        reporters, Playwright HTML/matrix/JSON reporters, Go test -json,
        pytest exit codes) to the gate actions {block-await-human,
        auto-remediate, record-only} and embed it in audit.md. Without
        it, "CRITICAL/HIGH blocks" is undefined for linters that only
        emit error/warning, for test suites that emit structured reports
        without severity labels, and the agent guesses.
        SELF-HEALING FAILURE BRANCH: if an auto-remediation attempt
        (MEDIUM/LOW) does not eliminate the finding on re-verify, treat
        it as a hard block and report to the human — do not attempt a
        second auto-fix. An auto-fix that fails once is a signal the
        finding requires human judgement, not a retry loop.
        Apply the §3.3 three-strike rule to any auto-fix attempt: three
        failed fix-and-re-verify cycles on the same finding → STOP,
        report verbatim, await human.
      - review.md: ledger-aware pre-PR gate — recompute the FULL fingerprint
        (Guide §4.2.3, including untracked files) and compare against
        gate_state.json; SKIP loudly only on exact match, printing the
        script-generated GATE REPORT verbatim (never a model-composed one).
        Otherwise: diff inventory, lockfile assertion (any lockfile diff
        without approved dependency = HARD STOP), per-changed-file layer
        compliance, secrets-in-diff grep, TIER 2 test execution (transitive
        closure for CORE_FILES), quarantine report (count + covered modules;
        a quarantined test covering CORE_FILES = HARD STOP), baseline-delta
        validation against audit receipts, conventional-commit verification,
        PR body generation; finish by having the gate script write the new
        receipt atomically.
      - prep.md: converts a natural-language task into a SCOPE / OBJECTIVE /
        CONSTRAINTS / VERIFY / OUTPUT execution contract, zero implementation,
        hard stops flagged at the top.

  C5. THE ENFORCEMENT LAYER:
      Do NOT generate or modify `.githooks/gate.sh`, `.githooks/pre-commit`, or `.githooks/pre-push`. These files have already been placed in the repository by the installation script. Leave them untouched. You must only verify that the `.githooks/` directory exists.

  C6. Stateful-layer bootstrap:
      - .claude/gate_state.json with empty receipts and last_pass_sha: null
        (written only by gate.sh from here on)
      - .claude/checkpoints/ with a README.md stating the schema from
        Guide §4.1.4 and the 10-file retention rule
      - quarantine.txt (empty, committed) with a header comment explaining
        Guide §6 T4

  C7. .gitignore additions (append, do not rewrite):
      .claude/gate_state.json
      .claude/checkpoints/

  C8. .team_aliases at the repository root: Read
      v1_claude_code_development_guide_existing.md from disk and copy
      APPENDIX B (the section headed "APPENDIX B — CANONICAL .team_aliases")
      VERBATIM into .team_aliases, substituting only the <source-dirs>
      placeholder with this repo's confirmed source and test directories
      (from the discovery report). If a placeholder has no confirmed value,
      ask — never guess. Beyond that substitution the file is byte-identical
      to Appendix B. Do not invent, add, or omit functions — security-relevant
      shell is never generated from memory.

PHASE D — VERIFICATION AND MANIFEST

  D1. Re-run the test suite in collection mode — confirm the init broke
      nothing (it wrote no source code; this is a sanity check).
  D2. Make a no-op commit on the setup branch to prove the pre-commit hook
      fires and emits a GATE REPORT; then verify the pre-push hook refuses
      a dry-run push to a protected branch name.
  D3. Output a manifest table: File | Purpose | Key rules encoded.
  D4. Output the three-line summary I can paste to my team lead:
      what was installed, what the baseline counts are, what changes about
      daily workflow (answer: type intent; hooks and tiers handle the rest).
  D5. Remind me: commit CLAUDE.md, .claude/settings.json, baseline.json,
      commands/, .githooks/, quarantine.txt, .team_aliases, .gitignore —
      and that gate_state.json and checkpoints/ stay untracked.

----------------------------------- PROMPT END -----------------------------------

## STEP 3 — REVIEW THE DISCOVERY REPORT (the one human checkpoint)

When Claude presents the Phase B report, check these six things before saying
"confirmed":

1. **Layer names match reality.** If it says "services layer" and your repo calls
   it `lib/`, correct it now — every future gate check depends on this.
2. **Commands are yours.** The test/lint commands must be the ones YOUR CI runs,
   not generic defaults.
3. **Debt identities look plausible.** Wildly low counts mean a scanner didn't
   run — ask. Every NO_SCANNER category should be explicitly listed.
4. **CORE_FILES list is sane.** Your shared utilities, config, base models, and
   fixtures should all be on it. A missing core file = tier 3 never fires for it.
5. **Test-impact tooling.** If Claude proposes installing one, approve or reject
   it HERE (it's a dependency hard stop).
6. **Hard-stop list covers your dangers.** Migrations directory? Deploy scripts?
   Add them.

Reply with corrections or "confirmed". Claude proceeds to Phase C without further
questions.

## STEP 4 — ACTIVATION (human developer action)

1. Review the generated CLAUDE.md once, end to end. It governs everything.
2. Verify hooks are active: `git config core.hooksPath` must print `.githooks`.
3. Commit the governance files on your setup branch:
   `git add CLAUDE.md .claude/settings.json .claude/baseline.json .claude/commands/ .githooks/ quarantine.txt .team_aliases .gitignore`
   `git commit -m "chore(claude): initialize agentic engineering environment"`
   (The pre-commit hook fires on this very commit — that's the system working.)
4. Open a PR — your team should see and approve the constitution like any code.
5. Activate aliases: `source .team_aliases`, then lock in:
   `echo "source $(pwd)/.team_aliases" >> ~/.zshrc`
6. Every teammate, after cloning/pulling: `cc-init-hooks` (one time).

## STEP 5 — DAILY WORKFLOW (from now on)

The mental model to internalize: **you talk to Claude normally.** You do not write
execution contracts by hand — the auto-pipeline (CLAUDE.md §9) derives one from any
code-change message, and the git hooks enforce the gate mechanically no matter what
the session does. Your only standing jobs are: use `/prep` for non-trivial work,
answer hard-stop questions, confirm pushes, and start a fresh session per task.

The loop is identical in both environments; only the surface differs. Read the
section for the client you use.

### 5A. CLAUDE CODE — CLI (terminal)

One-time, per clone (DO THIS FIRST or the local hooks never fire):

```
source .team_aliases                 # or rely on the ~/.zshrc line from STEP 4
cc-init-hooks                         # sets core.hooksPath + bypass-note refspecs
```

Then, end to end:

1. **Start a task.** `cc-feature "add an overdue-invoice filter"` — the wrapper
   refuses to launch on main/master/develop ("create a feature branch first")
   before Claude even starts. For a small, well-scoped change this is all you type.
2. **Scope something bigger first.** `/prep <description>` inside the session →
   review the SCOPE/OBJECTIVE/CONSTRAINTS contract → correct it in plain English →
   it executes. Use `cc-scope <symbol>` to see a change's impact radius first.
3. **Answer hard stops.** When the agent hits a new dependency, schema change,
   auth change, or a governance file, it STOPS and asks. Reply with the decision.
   It cannot edit CLAUDE.md / settings.json / baseline.json / .githooks — those
   are human-PR-only, and it will say so if you ask.
4. **Commit + push.** Say `commit and push`. The model runs audit → review →
   tiered tests and prints a GATE REPORT (loud SKIPs on unchanged parts). It then
   states the branch + remote and waits for your `yes` (Gate Step 4). The
   pre-commit / pre-push hooks fire mechanically regardless.
   - Prefer `cc-push`: it prints branch + remote and makes you **type the branch
     name** at the terminal (`/dev/tty`) to confirm — a fourth, model-independent
     human gate. The `git push` permission prompt appears as a terminal y/n.
5. **Next task = new session.** One task per session. A new session in the repo
   auto-resumes from `.claude/checkpoints/LATEST.md`; `cc-checkpoint` writes one
   by hand before you stop. Heed the §7.1.1 cost warning — `/compact` or restart.
6. **Emergency only.** `SKIP_GATE=1 git commit ...` typed BY YOU in a plain
   terminal (never through the agent — it's deny-listed). The hook demands a typed
   reason via `/dev/tty`, records a git note, and starts the 24h re-run clock.

### 5B. CLAUDE CODE — Desktop app

One-time, per clone (DO THIS FIRST or the local hooks never fire). The app has no
shell aliases, so run the activation directly in the repo, or use the setup target:

```
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
git config --add remote.origin.push  'refs/notes/bypasses:refs/notes/bypasses'
git config --add remote.origin.fetch '+refs/notes/bypasses:refs/notes/bypasses'
```

Then, end to end:

1. **Start a task.** Type the request in chat in plain English, or use `/feature
   <description>`. There is no `cc-feature` branch-guard wrapper here — instead the
   pipeline's Phase 0 pre-flight checks the branch and refuses to proceed on
   main/master/develop. Same protection, enforced inside the pipeline.
2. **Scope something bigger first.** `/prep <description>` → review the contract in
   chat → correct it → it executes. This is the recommended path for anything
   multi-file or touching shared/core modules.
3. **Answer hard stops.** Same as CLI — the agent stops and asks on new deps,
   schema, auth, or governance files, and cannot edit the trust-root files.
4. **Commit + push.** Say `commit and push`. Same GATE REPORT, same hooks. The
   difference: **the `git push` permission prompt is a UI approval card**, not a
   terminal y/n, and there is no `cc-push` "type the branch" step — so the **Gate
   Step 4 chat confirmation is your primary human gate.** Actually read the
   branch + remote line before clicking Allow; don't reflex-approve the dialog.
5. **Next task = new conversation.** Start a new conversation for an unrelated
   task. Checkpoints are written automatically at phase boundaries; if you want
   one before stopping, just say "write a checkpoint." Heed the §7.1.1 cost warning.
6. **Emergency only.** Same rule: `SKIP_GATE=1 git commit ...` is typed BY YOU in a
   real terminal outside the app — the agent is deny-listed from forming it, and
   the hook's `/dev/tty` reason prompt cannot be answered by the app's subprocess.

## WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE (first two weeks)

| Signal | Expected |
|---|---|
| First gate run | Passes despite existing debt (baseline absorbs it by identity) |
| Small change after a push | Gate completes in seconds with loud script-emitted SKIPs |
| New SQL injection introduced deliberately (try it) | Pre-commit hook BLOCKS — new fingerprint not in baseline, even if you also fixed an old finding in the same file |
| Brand-new untracked file with a finding | Gate runs (fingerprint includes untracked files) and BLOCKS |
| `SKIP_GATE=1` from a Claude session | Blocked by settings deny; TTY adds human-presence assurance where the agent has no terminal |
| Session killed mid-task, reopened | Resume from checkpoint in under a minute |
| baseline.json after 10 merged PRs | Identity entries strictly fewer than at init, each decrease backed by an audit receipt |
